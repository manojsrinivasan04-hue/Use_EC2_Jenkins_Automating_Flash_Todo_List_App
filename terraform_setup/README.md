Flask To-Do List App
This is a simple Flask-based To-Do List application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in AWS DynamoDB, and flash messages are displayed for task actions.

Features
*Add new tasks
*Mark tasks as completed
*Delete tasks
*Flash messages for task actions


Prerequisites
1) AWS Account: You’ll need an AWS account to set up DynamoDB and configure the AWS CLI.
2) Python 3.10+: This project uses Python for its backend logic.
3) Flask: A lightweight web framework to create the app.
4) Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with DynamoDB.
5) AWS CLI: Command line tool for configuring AWS services.

# Installation
  1.Clone the respository:
    ( https://github.com/manojsrinivasan04-hue/Use_EC2_Jenkins_Automating_Flash_Todo_List_App.git )
  2.Create a python virtual environment:
    * python3 -m venv flask-env
  3.Activate the virtual environment:
     .On Windows:
       * flask-env\Scripts\activate
     .On Macos/Linux:
       * source flask-env/bin/activate
  4.Install dependencies:
      * pip install -r requirements.txt


Setting up DynamoDB
  1. Create a DynamoDB table named todo_tasks:

  To create the DynamoDB table, follow these steps:

  *Open the @AWS DynamoDB Console.
  *Click on Create Table.
  *In the Table name field, enter todo_tasks.
  *Set Partition key as task_id with type String.
  *Leave the default settings for the rest of the options and click on Create.
  2. DynamoDB Table Schema:

  The table schema should have at least the following attributes:

   *task_id (String) - Partition Key
   *task_name (String)
   *completed (Boolean)

Configuring AWS CLI
 1. Install AWS CLI (if not already installed):

    Follow the instructions from the @AWS CLI Documentation.

 2. Configure AWS CLI:

    Run the following command to configure your AWS CLI:

    *aws configure
 You'll need to provide your:

  .AWS Access Key ID
  .AWS Secret Access Key
  .Default region name (e.g., us-east-1)
  .Default output format (e.g., json)
 3. Ensure that DynamoDB permissions are enabled for the IAM user whose credentials you are using.




Configuring the Application
 1. Update config.py:

  In the config.py file, update the following values:

  class Config:
    # AWS DynamoDB Configuration
    AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1'  # Set to your AWS region
    DYNAMODB_TABLE = 'todo_tasks'  # Name of your DynamoDB table

Running the Application
 1. Run the Flask app:

   Start the Flask development server:

  *flask run
The application will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

 2. Access the To-Do List App:

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You should be able to see the app's user interface, where you can add, complete, and delete tasks.
